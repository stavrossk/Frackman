# FrackMan

This project involves the development of a small Dig-Dug clone called FrackMan.

The primary purpose of this project was to tackle Object-Oriented Programming problems on as large a scale as a full-sized game.

I did not create any of the sound or graphics assets, but I was responsible for coding in-game logic for each of the game's "Actors",
as well as designing a framework for initializing the game's "world", placing each of the Actors in their proper location, and calling upon each of them to do something (...through an appropriately titled function "doSomething()") each game tick.
